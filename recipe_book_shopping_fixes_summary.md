# Recipe Book and Shopping Navigation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Recipe Book Favorites Count Showing Zero
**Problem**: The favorites count in recipe book statistics was showing 0 even when there were favorite recipes.

**Root Cause**: 
- The recipe provider wasn't properly updating the `isFavorite` status on recipes
- The statistics weren't being recalculated when favorites were toggled
- Storage initialization wasn't being ensured before data operations

**Fixes Applied**:
✅ **Enhanced Recipe Loading**: Modified `loadRecipes()` to properly set `isFavorite` status on all recipes
✅ **Improved Toggle Favorite**: Updated `toggleFavorite()` to immediately update state for better UX
✅ **Storage Initialization**: Added proper storage initialization calls in service methods
✅ **Statistics Update**: Fixed statistics calculation to reflect current favorite count
✅ **Added CustomErrorWidget**: Created missing error widget for proper error handling

### 2. Shopping Navigation "View All" Not Working
**Problem**: Clicking "View All" in shopping screen didn't navigate to pantry or shopping list screens.

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing sub-routes in the router configuration
- Routes `/shopping/pantry` and `/shopping/list` were not defined
- Missing simple screen implementations

**Fixes Applied**:
✅ **Added Sub-routes**: Extended shopping route with pantry and list sub-routes
✅ **Created Simple Screens**: Added `SimplePantryScreen` and `SimpleShoppingListScreen`
✅ **Fixed Navigation**: Updated router to handle `/shopping/pantry` and `/shopping/list` paths
✅ **Proper Route Structure**: Organized routes hierarchically under shopping parent route
