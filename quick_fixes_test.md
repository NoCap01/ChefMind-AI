# Quick Fixes Test Plan

## Issues to Test:

### 1. Meal Planner Persistence
**Test Steps:**
1. Go to Meal Planner
2. Create a new meal plan
3. Add some meals to different days
4. Navigate away from meal planner
5. Come back to meal planner
6. Check if the meal plan is still there

**Expected Result:** Meal plan should persist and be visible when returning

### 2. Shopping Screen "All" Filter
**Test Steps:**
1. Go to Shopping & Pantry screen
2. Click on "All" filter chip
3. Verify all sections are visible:
   - Pantry Items (if any exist)
   - Shopping List Items (if any exist)
   - Expiring Items (if any exist)
   - Low Stock Items (if any exist)

**Expected Result:** All sections should be visible when "All" is selected

### 3. Recipe Book Favorites Count
**Test Steps:**
1. Go to Recipe Book
2. Go to Statistics tab
3. Check the Favorites count
4. Go back to My Recipes tab
5. Toggle favorite on a recipe
6. Go back to Statistics tab
7. Check if Favorites count increased

**Expected Result:** Favorites count should update correctly

### 4. Recipe Book UI Cleanup
**Test Steps:**
1. Go to Recipe Book
2. Verify there's no search bar at the top
3. Verify there's no three dots menu in the app bar
4. Only grid/list toggle should be present

**Expected Result:** Clean UI without search and menu

## Current Status:

### âœ… Fixed:
- Meal planner now uses SharedPreferences for persistence
- Shopping screen filtering logic is correct
- Recipe book UI is cleaned up
- Widget disposal error is fixed

### ðŸ”„ To Verify:
- Test actual functionality in the running app
- Verify data persistence works correctly
- Check if all filters show appropriate content

## Implementation Notes:

1. **Meal Planner**: Now uses `SimplePersistenceService` with SharedPreferences
2. **Shopping Screen**: Filter logic checks `_selectedFilter == 'all'` correctly
3. **Recipe Book**: Search bar and menu removed, statistics use real-time data
4. **Error Fix**: Added `mounted` check for async ref usage
